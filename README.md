# About this project

In this project, I am trying to learn how to write APIs with Flask framework which is the framework for Python language to create APIs. I will use it to make a store which has several items in it and every item has a name and price.

# Runing the server

In order to run the server, you should make sure that you have Python installed on your machine. After making sure that you have Python on your machine, you should run the app file with the following command in your terminal :

``` python3 app.py ```
